Tenants and Entities are two of the layers that make up the Deposits infrastructure. Here are a few concepts you should be familiar with to integrate Deposits into your project with ease.

- Tenants:

  Tenant is a term used to describe a business or organization, or in this case, you, using the Deposits API to offer financial products and services to other entities.

- Entities:

  An entity is a single, distinct object that has the ability to conduct transactions on your platform (built on Deposits). On Deposits, we have two types of entities â€” Individual entities, and Business entities.
  An individual entity is registered as a person. Business entities, on the other hand, are organizations that have been registered. Every business entity, however, originates with an individual entity.

- Users:

  A user is an everyday person (or an entity) who uses your application, such as a mobile app, web app, desktop app, etc., to access the Deposits Platform API.

- Program:

  A program means a financial service offered by a Deposits Tenant with respect to which Deposits (including its partner processors) services are provided, including any Account, Wallet, KYC or any Card. A Program will allow Tenants to offer financial services to their users. Each program (also known as Client) is preconfigured to match the specific MSA (Master Service Agreement) signed between Deposits, Deposits Partners and the Tenant. The console enables the Tenant runs multiple Programs concurrently in a sort of multi-tenancy (multiple clients consuming Deposits services as its own customer-facing brand).

- Microdeposits:

  Microdeposits are little amounts of money, usually less than $1, transferred into an individual's bank account. These deposits are used to verify the user's identity and bank account.
