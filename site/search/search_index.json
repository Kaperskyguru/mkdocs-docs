We take care of the heavy lifting for you so you can focus on creating a product that delights your users. Traditional banking already offers a shortlist of functions, but currently lacks the benefits to match the tastes and use cases modern banking customers expect. This is where your partnership with Deposits becomes the leverage you can bank on. What do you need to launch and operate a Bank these days: Banking licenses coverage KYC / AML & Fraud prevention Ledgers and reconciliation Secure datastore Partnerships Web / iOS / Android applications Payment gateway Dedicated technical support With Deposits, partners can go live faster than ever before by leveraging our 3rd party licenses, certifications, microservices, and API infrastructure. Our API documentation is here to help you get from A to B in no time at all. Building your bank Creating and Verifying your Customers The first thing you would want to do when you are opening a bank account for an individual or business would be to create a new customer. These customers could either be individual users or businesses. The steps taken to open accounts for these different types of customers would vary. Let's start with opening an account for an individual. Creating an Account for an Individual To create an account for an individual, you need to collect basic information such as their first and last names, email address, and physical address of the user. These are the fields required to have on a user. They are also needed to create a user with us. Our API documentation provides the necessary information needed to create a new user. After you create a new user, a lot of information is returned and a response similar to this is returned: { \"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Account created successful.\", \"data\": { \"user\": { \"first_name\": \"Fred\", \"last_name\": \"Williams\", \"username\": \"f_williams\", \"email\": \"customer@email.com\", \"id\": 612 }, \"wallet\": 0 } } Creating an Account for a Business Understandably, more information is needed to create an account for a business than is needed for an individual. You would need The name of the business Business address Date of incorporation means of identifying this business as a legal entity. The methods of verification that are currently supported are DUNS and Employer Identification Number (EIN). Verifying your Customers In banking, it's important to verify the identities of individuals and ensure that these customers are who they say they are. To help with this, we have a standalone product, KYSync. KYSync allows you to pass the information you have previously collected from your customer and run a couple of checks on that customer to verify their identity. This system of verification is currently only available within the US. To verify a user, you would need their Social Security Number (SSN) alongside their base information. This information is then passed across to KYSync and a response is received showing if the customer is who they say they are or not. The time taken to verify customers varies depending on the type of entity. To verify an individual, you can call this endpoint. You will get a response similar to this: { \"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Account created successful.\", \"data\": { \"user\": { \"first_name\": \"Fred\", \"last_name\": \"Williams\", \"username\": \"f_williams\", \"email\": \"customer@email.com\", \"id\": 612 }, \"wallet\": 0 } } Storing value The way value is stored is through wallets. Deposits automatically creates a ledger for each new user upon creation. The balance in the user's account is stored in a wallet and the transaction history is readily available for the individuals to upon request. Collecting Payments There are various ways you can receive payments from users on the platform. They include: Via Deposits Payment Pages Via Bank Account Via Card via Deposits Payment pages Our payment pages automatically generate invoices and allow you receive payments. This is the recommended way to get payments from users. You can create a payment page by calling this endpoint. A sample body passed along with the request would look like: { \"api_key\": \"KwjqFjcvQxUHczQJ\", \"user_id\": \"34521\", \"name\": \"Swift Technologies\", \"description\": \"Get the very best technology at swift technologies\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"msi Optix AG32CQ\", \"description\": \"msi 32in curved monitor\", \"amount\": 450.0, \"quantity\": 1 } ] } This will return a response similar to this: { \"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Payment Page saved\", \"data\": { \"id\": 7, \"client_id\": \"7\", \"user_id\": \"34521\", \"name\": \"Swift Technologies\", \"description\": \"Get the very best technology at swift technologies\", \"amount\": 450.0, \"paid_at\": null, \"extra_info\": null, \"payment_type\": null, \"payment_interval\": null, \"payment_key\": \"a306248c72ce4ad\", \"total\": \"450.00\", \"status\": \"active\", \"created_at\": \"2021-08-25T14:33:08.000000Z\", \"updated_at\": \"2021-08-25T14:33:08.000000Z\", \"link\": \"https://api.deposits.dev/payment_page/cafecito/88497ae7d640e5a\", \"items\": [ { \"id\": 9, \"client_id\": \"7\", \"payment_page_id\": \"7\", \"name\": \"msi Optix AG32CQ\", \"description\": \"msi 32in curved monitor\", \"amount\": \"450.00\", \"quantity\": \"1\", \"status\": \"active\", \"created_at\": \"2021-08-25T14:33:08.000000Z\", \"updated_at\": \"2021-08-25T14:33:08.000000Z\" } ] } } via Bank Account You may initiate a request to debit a bank account.

Here are a few concepts you should be familiar with to integrate Deposits into your project with ease. Tenants: Tenant is a term used to describe a business or organization, or in this case, you, using the Deposits API to offer financial products and services to other entities. Entities: An entity is a single, distinct object that has the ability to conduct transactions on your platform (built on Deposits). On Deposits, we have two types of entities \u2014 Individual entities, and Business entities. An individual entity is registered as a person. Business entities, on the other hand, are organizations that have been registered. Every business entity, however, originates with an individual entity. Users: A user is an everyday person (or an entity) who uses your application, such as a mobile app, web app, desktop app, etc., to access the Deposits Platform API. Program: A program means a financial service offered by a Deposits Tenant with respect to which Deposits (including its partner processors) services are provided, including any Account, Wallet, KYC or any Card. A Program will allow Tenants to offer financial services to their users. Each program (also known as Client) is preconfigured to match the specific MSA (Master Service Agreement) signed between Deposits, Deposits Partners and the Tenant. The console enables the Tenant runs multiple Programs concurrently in a sort of multi-tenancy (multiple clients consuming Deposits services as its own customer-facing brand). Microdeposits: Microdeposits are little amounts of money, usually less than $1, transferred into an individual's bank account. These deposits are used to verify the user's identity and bank account.
